## 🤖 Jenkins for CI/CD

You can automate your build and deployment process using **Jenkins**.

### 📦 Set Up Jenkins Pipeline

1️⃣ **Install Jenkins and required plugins**  
Ensure Jenkins is installed on your machine, and you have the necessary plugins (e.g., Git, NodeJS, Docker).

2️⃣ **Set up a Jenkinsfile**  
In the root of your project, create a `Jenkinsfile` to define the CI/CD pipeline. Example:
```groovy
    pipeline {
        agent any
        stages {
        stage('Clean Workspace') {
            steps {
                cleanWs()
            }
        }

        stage('Clone Repository') {
            steps {
                bat "git clone %REPO_URL%"
            }
        }

        stage('Build Docker Images') {
            steps {
                timeout(time: 10, unit: 'MINUTES') {
                    dir("${PROJECT_NAME}") {
                        bat 'docker-compose build'
                    }
                }
            }
        }


        stage('Tag Docker Image') {
            steps {
                bat 'docker tag online-local-mart-backend %IMAGE_NAME%'
            }
        }

        stage('Login to DockerHub') {
            steps {
                bat "echo %DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS_PSW% | docker login -u %DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS_USR% --password-stdin"
            }
        }

        stage('Push to DockerHub') {
            steps {
                bat 'docker push %IMAGE_NAME%'
            }
        }

        stage('Start Containers') {
            steps {
                dir("${PROJECT_NAME}") {
                    bat 'docker-compose up -d'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Verify Running Containers') {
            steps {
                bat 'docker ps -a'
            }
        }
    }
        }
    }
```

3️⃣ **Run the Jenkins pipeline**  
After configuring your Jenkins pipeline, trigger the build process either manually or automatically on code changes.

4️⃣ **Monitor the build progress**
